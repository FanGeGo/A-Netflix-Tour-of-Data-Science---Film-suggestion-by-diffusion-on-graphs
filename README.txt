------------------- Usefull informations

This repository is cut into different notebook and folders. 

The main notebook, holding the key parts of the code for the application we want to realise is entitled: "A_Netflix_Tour_of_Data_Science_Film_suggestion_by_diffusion_on_graphs".
The other notebooks are used to compute data and exports elements needed for the main notebook.
More information on the different notebooks are available inside the corresponding notebook.

Already computed data and the dataset used in this project are in the folder: "Dataset_Exports".

If the folder is empty or not present you will need the following dataset as a starting point: Kaggle dataset - Films and Crew
Then the notebooks must be ran in the following order: 
    1. "Adjacency_Cast"
    2. "Adjacency_First_Role"
    3. "Adjacency_Genres"
    4. "Adjacency_Crew"
    5. At this point the different graphs must be exported to a csv file.
    6. "Signal_Vote_Average"
    7. "A_Netflix_Tour_of_Data_Science_Film_suggestion_by_diffusion_on_graphs"
